If you use if instead of else if in your code, here's what will happen:

Current Code:
cpp
Copy code
if(j < n - i - 1) {
    cout << " ";
}
else if(j <= n + i - 1) {
    cout << "*";
}
Scenario: Using Two if Statements
If you replace else if with if, like this:

cpp
Copy code
if(j < n - i - 1) {
    cout << " ";
}
if(j <= n + i - 1) {
    cout << "*";
}
Result of Using if Instead of else if:
Both Conditions are Checked: Both if statements will always be evaluated independently. So, even if the first if condition is true (which means a space is printed), the second if condition is still checked. If it is also true, a star * will be printed in the same column after the space.

Incorrect Output: Because both conditions will be evaluated for the same j value, spaces and stars will be printed one after the other in the same column. This would lead to a misaligned pattern, with spaces and stars appearing in unexpected places, rather than forming a neat pyramid.

For example, for n = 5, the output might look something like this:

markdown
Copy code
    * 
   ** 
  *** 
 **** 
*****
As you can see, the stars are not aligned properly because for some positions, both a space and a star are being printed in the same iteration.

Conclusion:
if + else if Approach: The else if ensures that only one of the two conditions is true for any given column, ensuring that either a space or a star is printed, but not both.
if + if Approach: Using two if conditions without else causes both conditions to be evaluated independently, which can lead to printing both a space and a star in the same column, resulting in incorrect output.
Thus, the else if is crucial to maintain the correct structure of the pattern.
